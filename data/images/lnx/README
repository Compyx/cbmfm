Various Lynx files:


filename            Lynx version
--------            ------------
GC97.LNX            Lynx IX - Will Corley
Too Wicked.lnx      Lynx XVI - Will Corley
Phobos.lnx          Star Lynx 0.80 - Joe Forster/STA
Handjob Lotion.lnx  Ultra Lynx 2001 - S.B.
party-demo.lnx      Ultimate Lynx II - Willy


GC97.LNX is corrupt: last directory entry is missing the 'remainder' value for
the last block. Could perhaps be fixed by examining file size of the Lynx
container.

Seems like Lynx 17 can dissolve Lynx files larger than 202 blocks, but cannot
create them. It also contains a bug where it ignores target settings, it will
always read AND write from/to source.


party-demo.lnx I created myself using Ultimate Lynx II on 'Party Demo' by GP+FE
